# Notes

## Processing a Guess

> _By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it
> brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and
> you can see everything in it at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html._

Language syntax:
- The keyword `use` is used to "import" types into scope.
- The keyword `let` created a new **immutable** variable. To make it mutable
  use `mut`.
- Comments can be initiated with `//`.
- Using `&` in an argument indicates that the argument is a **reference**.
  References are also immutable by defaultâ€”to make them mutable we need to use
  `&mut`
- Strings can be interpolated with `{}` (placeholders).

The `std::io::stdin` function returns an instance of `std::io::Stdin`, which is
a type that handles the terminal's standard input.

`read_line` returns a `Result`, which is an enumeration with variants `Ok` and
`Err`.

> [!NOTE]
> If we don't add the `use` statement, the error looks like this:
> ```text

## Generating a Secret Number

Language syntax:
- `start..=end` creates a lower- and upper-bound inclusive range.

A `Trait` defines a functionality for a particular type, that can be shared
with other types.

## Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

> _A `match` expression is made up of arms. An arm consists of a pattern to
> match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to `match`
> fits that arm's pattern.

General ideas:
- Rust is strongly typed, but also has type inference.
- It's possible to reuse a variable (**shadowing**).

The `parse` method converts strings to other types.

> [!NOTE]
> Not parsing the string creates a compilation error:
> ```text
> Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (/.../chapter-02/guessing_game)
> error[E0308]: mismatched types
> --> src/main.rs:27:25

## Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

Language syntax:
- The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. We can use `break` to exit it.

> [!TIP]
> The original code in the book uses the `println!` macro to prompt an input
> from the user. This breaks a line between the text and the user's input. To
> prevent that, I decided to use the `print!` macro, which doesn't insert a new
> line, but it requires flushing the standard output:
> ```rust
> use std::io::Write;
> 
> io::stdout()
>   .flush()
>   .expect("Failed to flush output");
