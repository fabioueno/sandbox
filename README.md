# Sandbox

This is a personal repository that serves as my digital **sandbox** for coding
experiments, small projects, and code snippets. It's a place for me to test new
technologies, explore concepts from books and tutorials, and practice my skills
without the pressure of creating a polished, production-ready application.

You'll find a variety of small, often incomplete, projects here.


## What's Inside?

The projects are organized by topic, technology, or source.

Each project directory will have its own `README.md` with more specific
details, if needed.


## Getting Started

Feel free to browse through the code. Since this is a personal space for
learning, the code here is not guaranteed to be perfect or production-ready.
