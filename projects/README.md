# Projects

This directory contains my personal pet projects â€” small utilities, tools, and
experiments that I build to solve specific problems or explore new ideas.

Each subdirectory represents a standalone project with its own purpose and
implementation. The code here is experimental and built for personal use, so
it might not be polished or production-ready.
